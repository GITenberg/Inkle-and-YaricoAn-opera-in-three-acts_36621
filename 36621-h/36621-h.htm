<h2>
    REMARKS.
</h2>
<p>
This is a drama, which might remove from Mr. Wilberforce his aversion
to theatrical exhibitions, and convince him, that the teaching of moral
duty is not confined to particular spots of ground; for, in those
places, of all others, the doctrine is most effectually inculcated,
where exhortation is the most required&mdash;the resorts of the gay, the
idle, and the dissipated.
</p>
<p>
This opera was written, when the author was very young; and, should
he live to be very old, he will have reason to be proud of it to his
latest day&mdash;for it is one of those plays which is independent of time,
of place, or of circumstance, for its value. It was popular before the
subject of the abolition of the slave trade was popular. It has the
peculiar honour of preceding that great question. It was the bright
forerunner of alleviation to the hardships of slavery.
</p>
<p>
The trivial faults of this opera are&mdash;too much play on words (as it is
called) by Trudge; and some classical

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page4" name="page4"></a>[4]</span>

                                      allusions by other characters,
in whose education such knowledge could not be an ingredient.
</p>
<p>
A fault more important, is&mdash;that the scene at the commencement of the
opera, instead of Africa, is placed in America. It would undoubtedly
have been a quick passage, to have crossed a fourth part of the
western globe, during the interval between the first and second acts;
still, as the hero and heroine of the drama were compelled to go to
sea&mdash;imagination, with but little more exertion, might have given them
a fair wind as well from the coast whence slaves are <i>really</i> brought,
as from a shore where no such traffic is held<a href="#note-1" name="noteref-1"><small> 1</small></a>.
</p>
<p>
As an opera, Inkle and Yarico has the singular merit not to be
protected, though aided, by the power of music: the characters are so
forcibly drawn, that even those performers who sing, and study that
art alone, can render every part effectual: and singers and actors of
future times, like those of the past, and of the present, will find
every character exactly suited to their talents.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page5" name="page5"></a>[5]</span></p>

<p>
This opera has been performed in every London theatre, and in every
theatre of the kingdom, with the same degree of splendid success. It
would have been wonderful had its reception been otherwise; for the
subject is a most interesting one, and in the treatment of it, the
author has shewn taste, judgment&mdash;virtue.
</p>

<p class="foot">
<a name="note-1"><!--Note--></a>
1 (<a href="#noteref-1"><small>return</small></a>)<br />
No doubt the author would have ingenuity to argue away
this objection&mdash;but that, which requires argument for its support in a
dramatic work, is a subject for complaint. As slaves are imported from
Africa, and never from America, the audience, in the two last acts of
this play, feel as if they had been in the wrong quarter of the globe
during the first act. Inkle could certainly steal a native from
America, and sell her in Barbadoes, but this is not so consonant with
that nice imitation of the order of things as to rank above criticism.

<h3>
SCENE I.
</h3>

<p class="scene">
    <i>An American Forest.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Medium.</i> <span class="dir-i">[<i>Without.</i>]</span> Hilli ho! ho!
</p>
<p>
<i>Trudge.</i> <span class="dir-i">[<i>Without.</i>]</span> Hip! hollo! ho!&mdash;Hip!&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p class="dir-c">
<i>Enter <span class="sc">Medium</span> and <span class="sc">Trudge</span>.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Med.</i> Pshaw! it's only wasting time and breath. Bawling won't persuade
him to budge a bit faster, and, whatever weight it may have in <i>some</i>
places, bawling, it seems, don't go for argument here. Plague on't! we
are now in the wilds of America.
</p>
<p>
<i>Trudge.</i> Hip, hillio&mdash;ho&mdash;hi!&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<i>Med.</i> Hold your tongue, you blockhead, or&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<i>Trudge.</i> Lord! sir, if my master makes no more haste, we shall all be
put to sword by the knives of the natives. I'm told they take off heads
like hats, and hang 'em on pegs, in their parlours. Mercy on us! My
head aches with the very thoughts of it. Hollo! Mr. Inkle! master;
hollo!
</p>
<p>
<i>Med.</i> <span class="dir-i">[<i>Stops his mouth.</i>]</span> Head aches! Zounds, so does mine, with your
confounded bawling. It's enough to bring all the natives about us; and
we shall be stripped and plundered in a minute.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page8" name="page8"></a>[8]</span></p>

<p>
<i>Trudge.</i> Aye; stripping is the first thing that would happen to us;
for they seem to be woefully off for a wardrobe. I myself saw three, at
a distance, with less clothes than I have, when I get out of bed: all
dancing about in black buff; just like Adam in mourning.
</p>
<p>
<i>Med.</i> This is to have to do with a schemer! a fellow who risks his
life, for a chance of advancing his interest.&mdash;Always advantage in
view! Trying, here, to make discoveries, that may promote his profit in
England. Another Botany Bay scheme, mayhap. Nothing else could induce
him to quit our foraging party, from the ship; when he knows every
inhabitant here is not only as black as a pepper-corn, but as hot into
the bargain&mdash;and <i>I</i>, like a fool, to follow him! and then to let him
loiter behind.&mdash;Why, nephew;&mdash;Why, Inkle.&mdash;<span class="dir-i">[<i>Calling.</i>]</span>
</p>
<p>
<i>Trudge.</i> Why, Inkle&mdash;&mdash;Well! only to see the difference of men! he'd
have thought it very hard, now, if I had let him call so often after
me. Ah! I wish he was calling after me now, in the old jog-trot way,
again. What a fool was I to leave London for foreign parts!&mdash;&mdash;That
ever I should leave Threadneedle-street, to thread an American forest,
where a man's as soon lost as a needle in a bottle of hay!
</p>
<p>
<i>Med.</i> Patience, Trudge! Patience! If we once recover the ship&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<i>Trudge.</i> Lord, sir, I shall never recover what I have lost in coming
abroad. When my master and I were in London, I had such a mortal snug
birth of it! Why, I was <i>factotum</i>.
</p>
<p>
<i>Med.</i> Factotum to a young merchant is no such sinecure, neither.
</p>
<p>
<i>Trudge.</i> But then the honour of it. Think of that, sir; to be clerk as
well as <i>own man</i>. Only consider. You find very few city clerks made
out of a man, now-a-days. To be king of the counting-house, as well as
lord of the bed-chamber. Ah! if I had him

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page9" name="page9"></a>[9]</span>

                                           but now in the little
dressing-room behind the office; tying his hair, with a bit of red
tape, as usual.
</p>
<p>
<i>Med.</i> Yes, or writing an invoice in lampblack, and shining his shoes
with an ink-bottle, <i>as usual</i>, you blundering blockhead!
</p>
<p>
<i>Trudge.</i> Oh, if I was but brushing the accounts or casting up the
coats! mercy on us! what's that?
</p>
<p>
<i>Med.</i> That! What?
</p>
<p>
<i>Trudge.</i> Didn't you hear a noise?
</p>
<p>
<i>Med.</i> Y&mdash;es&mdash;but&mdash;hush! Oh, heavens be praised! here he is at last.
</p>

<p class="dir-c">
<i>Enter <span class="sc">Inkle</span>.</i>
</p>

<p>
Now, nephew!
</p>
<p>
<i>Inkle.</i> So, Mr. Medium.
</p>
<p>
<i>Med.</i> Zounds, one would think, by your confounded composure, that you
were walking in St. James's Park, instead of an American forest: and
that all the beasts were nothing but good company. The hollow trees,
here, sentry boxes, and the lions in 'em, soldiers; the jackalls,
courtiers; the crocodiles, fine women; and the baboons, beaus. What the
plague made you loiter so long?
</p>
<p>
<i>Inkle.</i> Reflection.
</p>
<p>
<i>Med.</i> So I should think; reflection generally comes lagging behind.
What, scheming, I suppose; never quiet. At it again, eh? What a happy
trader is your father, to have so prudent a son for a partner! Why, you
are the carefullest Co. in the whole city. Never losing sight of the
main chance; and that's the reason, perhaps, you lost sight of us,
here, on the main of America.
</p>
<p>
<i>Inkle.</i> Right, Mr. Medium. Arithmetic, I own, has been the means of
our parting at present.
</p>
<p>
<i>Trudge.</i> Ha! A sum in division, I reckon.
</p>

<p class="dir-r">
[<i>Aside.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Med.</i> And pray, if I may be so bold, what mighty
scheme has just tempted you to employ your head,
when you ought to make use of your heels?
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page10" name="page10"></a>[10]</span></p>

<p>
<i>Inkle.</i> My heels! Here's pretty doctrine! Do you think I travel merely
for motion? What, would you have a man of business come abroad, scamper
extravagantly here and there and every where, then return home, and
have nothing to tell, but that he has <i>been</i> here and there and every
where? 'Sdeath, sir, would you have me travel like a lord?
</p>
<p>
<i>Med.</i> No, the Lord forbid!
</p>
<p>
<i>Inkle.</i> Travelling, uncle, was always intended for improvement; and
improvement is an advantage; and advantage is profit, and profit is
gain. Which in the travelling translation of a trader, means, that you
should gain every advantage of improving your profit. I have been
comparing the land, here, with that of our own country.
</p>
<p>
<i>Med.</i> And you find it like a good deal of the land of our own
country&mdash;&mdash;cursedly encumbered with black legs, I take it.
</p>
<p>
<i>Inkle.</i> And calculating how much it might be made to produce by the
acre.
</p>
<p>
<i>Med.</i> You were?
</p>
<p>
<i>Inkle.</i> Yes; I was proceeding algebraically upon the subject.
</p>
<p>
<i>Med.</i> Indeed!
</p>
<p>
<i>Inkle.</i> And just about extracting the square root.
</p>
<p>
<i>Med.</i> Hum!
</p>
<p>
<i>Inkle.</i> I was thinking too, if so many natives could be caught, how
much they might fetch at the West Indian markets.
</p>
<p>
<i>Med.</i> Now let me ask you a question, or two, young cannibal catcher,
if you please.
</p>
<p>
<i>Inkle.</i> Well.
</p>
<p>
<i>Med.</i> Ar'n't we bound for Barbadoes; partly to trade, but chiefly to
carry home the daughter of the governor, Sir Christopher Curry, who has
till now been under your father's care, in Threadneedle-street, for
polite English education?
</p>
<p>
<i>Inkle.</i> Granted.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page11" name="page11"></a>[11]</span></p>

<p>
<i>Med.</i> And isn't it determined, between the old folks, that you are to
marry Narcissa, as soon as we get there?
</p>
<p>
<i>Inkle.</i> A fixed thing.
</p>
<p>
<i>Med.</i> Then what the devil do you do here, hunting old hairy negroes,
when you ought to be obliging a fine girl in the ship? Algebra, too!
You'll have other things to think of when you are married, I promise
you. A plodding fellow's head, in the hands of a young wife, like a
boy's slate, after school, soon gets all its arithmetic wiped off: and
then it appears in its true simple state: dark, empty, and bound in
wood, Master Inkle.
</p>
<p>
<i>Inkle.</i> Not in a match of this kind. Why, it's a table of interest
from beginning to end, old Medium.
</p>
<p>
<i>Med.</i> Well, well, this is no time to talk. Who knows but, instead of
sailing to a wedding, we may get cut up, here, for a wedding dinner:
tossed up for a dingy duke, perhaps, or stewed down for a black
baronet, or eat raw by an inky commoner?
</p>
<p>
<i>Inkle.</i> Why sure you ar'n't afraid?
</p>
<p>
<i>Med.</i> Who, I afraid? Ha! ha! ha! No, not I! What the deuce should I
be afraid of? Thank Heaven I have a clear conscience, and need not be
afraid of any thing. A scoundrel might not be quite so easy on such
an occasion; but it's the part of an honest man not to behave like a
scoundrel: I never behaved like a scoundrel&mdash;for which reason I am an
honest man, you know. But come&mdash;I hate to boast of my good qualities.
</p>
<p>
<i>Inkle.</i> Slow and sure, my good, virtuous Mr. Medium! Our companions
can be but half a mile before us: and, if we do but double their steps,
we shall overtake 'em at one mile's end, by all the powers of arithmetic.
</p>
<p>
<i>Med.</i> Oh curse your arithmetic!

three land lubbers, that edged away in the morning, goes for nothing,
you know&mdash;they're all dead, may-hap, by this.

brought safe aboard to-night, you may all chance to have a salt eel for
your supper&mdash;that's all&mdash;Moreover the young plodding spark, he with the
grave, foul weather face, there, is to man the tight little frigate,
Miss Narcissa&mdash;what d'ye call her? that is bound with us for Barbadoes.
Rot'em for not keeping under weigh, I say! But come, let's see if a
song will bring 'em too. Let's have a full chorus to the good merchant
ship, the Achilles, that's wrote by our captain.

<p>
<i>Inkle.</i> So far, at least, we have proceeded with safety. Ha! no bad
specimen of savage elegance. These ornaments would be worth something
in England.&mdash;We have little to fear here, I hope: this cave rather
bears the pleasing face of a profitable adventure.
</p>
<p>
<i>Trudge.</i> Very likely, sir! But for a pleasing face, it has the
cursed'st ugly month I ever saw in my life. Now do, sir, make off as
fast as you can. If we once get clear of the natives' houses, we have
little to fear from the lions and leopards: for by the appearance of
their parlours, they seem to have killed all the wild beast in the
country. Now pray, do, my good master, take my advice, and run away.
</p>
<p>
<i>Inkle.</i> Rascal! Talk again of going out, and I'll flea you alive.
</p>
<p>
<i>Trudge.</i> That's just what I expect for coming in.&mdash;All that enter here
appear to have had their skins stript over their ears; and ours will be
kept for curiosities&mdash;We shall stand here, stuffed, for a couple of
white wonders.
</p>
<p>

disturbing the company: you may get a curtain-lecture, perhaps, sir.

grey hair, eh, my pretty beauty spot?

<p>

</p>
<p>
<i>Trudge.</i> Oh! wore a wig. But the old boy taught you something more
than English, I believe.
</p>
<p>
<i>Wows.</i> Iss.
</p>
<p>
<i>Trudge.</i> The devil he did! What was it?
</p>
<p>
<i>Wows.</i> Teach me put dry grass, red hot, in hollow white stick.
</p>
<p>
<i>Trudge.</i> Aye, what was that for?
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<i>Trudge.</i> Zounds! did he teach you to smoke?
</p>
<p>
<i>Wows.</i> Iss.
</p>
<p>
<i>Trudge.</i> And what became of him at last? What did your countrymen do
for the poor fellow?
</p>
<p>
<i>Wows.</i> Eat him one day&mdash;Our chief kill him.
</p>
<p>
<i>Trudge.</i> Mercy on us! what damned stomachs, to swallow a tough old
tar! Ah, poor Trudge! your killing comes next.
</p>

</p>
<p>
<i>Wows.</i> I fight for you!
</p>
<p>
<i>Trudge.</i> Will you? Ecod she's a brave good-natured wench! she'll be
worth a hundred of your English wives.&mdash;Whenever they fight on their
husband's account, it's <i>with</i> him instead of <i>for</i> him, I fancy. But
how the plague am I to live here?

<p>
<i>Wows.</i> I feed you&mdash;bring you kid.

this, if my master and I find our way to England, you shall be part of
our travelling equipage; and, when I get there, I'll give you a couple

to write and dress hair.
</p>
<p>
<i>Wows.</i> You great man in your country?
</p>
<p>
<i>Trudge.</i> Oh yes, a very great man. I'm head clerk of the counting-house,
and first valet-de-chambre of the dressing-room. I pounce parchments,
powder hair, black shoes, ink paper, shave beards, and mend pens. But
hold! I had forgot one material point&mdash;you ar'n't married, I hope?
</p>
<p>
<i>Wows.</i> No: you be my chum-chum!
</p>
<p>

single; for Indian husbands are not quite so complaisant as English
ones, and the vulgar dogs might think of looking a little after their
spouses. But you have had a lover or two in your time; eh, Wowski?

</p>

<p>
<i>1st Plant.</i> I saw her this morning, gentlemen, you may depend on't. My
telescope never fails me. I popp'd upon her as I was taking a peep from
my balcony. A brave tight ship, I tell you, bearing down directly for
Barbadoes here.
</p>
<p>
<i>2d Plant.</i> Ods, my life! rare news! We have not had a vessel arrive in
our harbour these six weeks.
</p>
<p>
<i>3d Plant.</i> And the last brought only Madam Narcissa, our Governor's
daughter, from England; with a parcel of lazy, idle, white folks about
her. Such cargoes will never do for our trade, neighbour.
</p>
<p>
<i>2d Plant.</i> No, no; we want slaves. A terrible

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page25" name="page25"></a>[25]</span>

                                               dearth of 'em in Barbadoes,
lately! But your dingy passengers for my money. Give me a vessel like a
collier, where all the lading tumbles out as black as my hat. But are you
sure, now, you ar'n't mistaken? <span class="dir-i">[<i>To 1st Planter.</i>]</span>
</p>
<p>
<i>1st Plant.</i> Mistaken! 'sbud, do you doubt my glass? I can discover a
gull by it six leagues off: I could see every thing as plain as if I
was on board.
</p>
<p>
<i>2d Plant.</i> Indeed! and what were her colours?
</p>
<p>
<i>1st Plant.</i> Um! why English&mdash;&mdash;or Dutch&mdash;&mdash;or French&mdash;&mdash;I don't
exactly remember.
</p>
<p>
<i>2d Plant.</i> What were the sailors aboard?
</p>
<p>
<i>1st Plant.</i> Eh! why they were English too&mdash;&mdash;or Dutch&mdash;&mdash;or
French&mdash;&mdash;I can't perfectly recollect.
</p>
<p>
<i>2d Plant.</i> Your glass, neighbour, is a little like a glass too much:
it makes you forget every thing you ought to remember. <span class="dir-i">[<i>Cry without</i>,

</p>
<p>

<p>
<i>Patty.</i> Well, ma'am, as I was saying&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<i>Nar.</i> Well, say no more of what you were saying&mdash;Sure, Patty, you
forget where you are; a little caution will be necessary now, I think.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page26" name="page26"></a>[26]</span></p>

<p>
<i>Patty.</i> Lord, madam, how is it possible to help talking? We are in
Barbadoes here, to be sure&mdash;but then, ma'am, one may let out a little
in a private morning's walk by ourselves.
</p>
<p>
<i>Nar.</i> Nay, it's the same thing with you in doors.
</p>
<p>
<i>Patty.</i> I never blab, ma'am, never, as I hope for a gown.
</p>
<p>
<i>Nar.</i> And your never blabbing, as you call it, depends chiefly on that
hope, I believe.
</p>
<p>
<i>Patty.</i> I have told the story of our voyage, indeed, to old Guzzle,
the butler.
</p>
<p>
<i>Nar.</i> And thus you lead him to imagine I am but little inclined to the
match.
</p>
<p>
<i>Patty.</i> Lord, ma'am, how could that be? Why I never said a word about
Captain Campley.
</p>
<p>
<i>Nar.</i> Hush! hush! for heaven's sake.
</p>
<p>
<i>Patty.</i> Aye! there it is now. But if our voyage from England was so
pleasant, it wasn't owing to Mr. Inkle, I'm certain. He didn't play the
fiddle in our cabin, and dance on the deck, and come languishing with a
glass of warm water in his hand, when we were sea-sick. Ah, ma'am, that
water warm'd your heart, I'm confident. Mr. Inkle! No, no; Captain
Cam&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<i>Nar.</i> There is no end to this! Remember, Patty, keep your secrecy, or
you entirely lose my favour.
</p>
<p>
<i>Patty.</i> Never fear me, ma'am. But if somebody I know is not acquainted
with the Governor, there's such a thing as dancing at balls, and
squeezing hands when you lead up, and squeezing them again when you
cast down. I'm as close as a patch box. Mum's the word, ma'am, I
promise you.
</p>
<p class="dir-r">
[<i>Exit.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Nar.</i> How awkward is my present situation! Promised to one, who,
perhaps, may never again be heard of; and who, I am sure, if he ever
appears to claim me, will do it merely on the score of interest&mdash;pressed
too by another, who has already, I fear, too much

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page27" name="page27"></a>[27]</span>

                                                  interest in my
heart&mdash;what can I do? What plan can I follow?
</p>

<p class="dir-c">
<i>Enter <span class="sc">Campley</span>.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Camp.</i> Follow my advice, Narcissa, by all means. Enlist with me under
the best banners in the world. General Hymen for my money! little
Cupid's his drummer: he has been beating a round rub-a-dub on our
hearts, and we have only to obey the word of command, fall into the
ranks of matrimony, and march through life together.
</p>
<p>
<i>Nar.</i> Then consider our situation.
</p>
<p>
<i>Camp.</i> That has been duly considered. In short, the case stands
exactly thus&mdash;your intended spouse is all for money; I am all for love.
He is a rich rogue; I am rather a poor honest fellow. He would pocket
your fortune; I will take you without a fortune in your pocket.
</p>
<p>
<i>Nar.</i> Oh! I am sensible of the favour, most gallant Captain Campley;
and my father, no doubt, will be very much obliged to you.
</p>
<p>
<i>Camp.</i> Aye, there's the devil of it! Sir Christopher Curry's confounded
good character knocks me up at once. Yet I am not acquainted with him
neither; not known to him even by sight; being here only as a private
gentleman, on a visit to my old relation, out of regimentals, and so
forth; and not introduced to the Governor, as other officers of the
place. But then, the report of his hospitality&mdash;his odd, blunt, whimsical
friendship&mdash;his whole behaviour&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<i>Nar.</i> All stare you in the face; eh, Campley?
</p>
<p>
<i>Camp.</i> They do, till they put me out of countenance.
</p>
<p>
<i>Nar.</i> What signifies talking to <i>me</i>, when you have such opposition
from others? Why hover about the city, instead of boldly attacking the
guard? Wheel about, captain! face the enemy! March! Charge! Rout
'em!&mdash;Drive 'em before you, and then&mdash;
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page28" name="page28"></a>[28]</span></p>

<p>
<i>Camp.</i> And then&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<i>Nar.</i> Lud ha' mercy on the poor city!
</p>

<p class="dir-c">
<i>Enter <span class="sc">Patty</span>, hastily.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Patty.</i> Oh lud, ma'am, I'm frightened out of my wits! sure as I'm
alive, ma'am, Mr. Inkle is not dead; I saw his man, ma'am, just now,
coming ashore in a boat, with other passengers, from the vessel that's
come to the island.
</p>
<p class="dir-r">
[<i>Exit.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Nar.</i> Then one way or other I must determine.&mdash;<span class="dir-i">[<i>To <span class="sc">Campley</span>.</i>]</span> Look'ye,
Mr. Campley, something has happened which makes me wave ceremonies.&mdash;If
you mean to apply to my father, remember, that delays are dangerous.
</p>
<p>
<i>Camp.</i> Indeed!
</p>
<p>
<i>Nar.</i> I mayn't be always in the same mind, you know. <span class="dir-i">[<i>Smiling.</i>]</span>
</p>
<p class="dir-r">
[<i>Exit.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Camp.</i> Nay, then&mdash;Gad, I'm almost afraid too&mdash;but living in this state
of doubt is torment. I'll e'en put a good face on the matter; cock my
hat; make my bow; and try to reason the Governor into compliance. Faint
heart never won a fair lady.

she's no christian!

<p>
<i>Trudge.</i> No; but I am; so I shall do as I'd be done by: and, if you

 wou'dn't be articled clerk to such a fellow for the world.

</p>
<p>
<i>Trudge.</i> Plague on't; there it is. I shall be laughed out of my
honesty, here.&mdash;But you may be jogging, friend; I may feel a little
queer, perhaps, at showing her face&mdash;but, dam me, if ever I do any

</p>
<p>
<i>Inkle.</i> Nay, sir, I understand your customs well; your Indian markets
are not unknown to me.
</p>
<p>
<i>2d Plant.</i> And, as you seem to understand business, I need not tell
you, that dispatch is the soul of it. Her name you say is&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<i>Inkle.</i> Yarico: but urge this no more, I beg you; I must not listen
to it: for, to speak freely, her anxious care of me demands, that
here,&mdash;though here it may seem strange&mdash;I should avow my love for her.
</p>
<p>
<i>Plant.</i> Lord help you for a merchant!&mdash;It's the first time I ever
heard a trader talk of love; except, indeed, the love of trade, and the
love of the <i>Sweet Molly</i>, my ship.
</p>
<p>
<i>Inkle.</i> Then, sir, you cannot feel my situation.
</p>
<p>
<i>Plant.</i> Oh yes, I can! we have a hundred such cases just after a
voyage; but they never last long on

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page34" name="page34"></a>[34]</span>

                                    land. It's amazing how constant
a young man is in a ship! But, in two words, will you dispose of her,
or no?
</p>
<p>
<i>Inkle.</i> In two words, then, meet me here at noon, and we'll speak
further on this subject: and lest you think I trifle with your
business, hear why I wish this pause. Chance threw me, on my passage to
your island, among a savage people. Deserted,&mdash;defenceless,&mdash;cut off
from companions,&mdash;my life at stake&mdash;to this young creature I owe my
preservation;&mdash;she found me, like a dying bough, torn from its kindred
branches; which, as it drooped, she moistened with her tears.
</p>
<p>
<i>Plant.</i> Nay, nay, talk like a man of this world.
</p>
<p>
<i>Inkle.</i> Your patience.&mdash;And yet your interruption goes to my present
feelings; for on our sail to this your island&mdash;the thoughts of time
mispent&mdash;doubt&mdash;fears&mdash;for call it what you will&mdash;have much perplexed
me; and as your spires arose, reflections still rose with them; for
here, sir, lie my interests, great connexions, and other weighty
matters&mdash;which now I need not mention&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<i>Plant.</i> But which her presence here will mar.
</p>
<p>
<i>Inkle.</i> Even so&mdash;And yet the gratitude I owe her&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<i>Plant.</i> Pshaw! So because she preserved your life, your gratitude is
to make you give up all you have to live upon.
</p>
<p>
<i>Inkle.</i> Why, in that light indeed&mdash;This never struck me yet, I'll
think on't.
</p>
<p>
<i>Plant.</i> Aye, aye, do so&mdash;Why, what return can the wench wish more than
taking her from a wild, idle, savage people, and providing for her,
here, with reputable hard work, in a genteel, polished, tender,
christian country?
</p>
<p>
<i>Inkle.</i> Well, sir, at noon&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<i>Plant.</i> I'll meet you&mdash;but remember, young gentleman, you must get her
off your hands&mdash;you must, indeed.&mdash;I shall have her a bargain, I see
that&mdash;your

<p>

The road is straight before you: you can't miss it.
</p>
<p>

me from morn to night&mdash;and still the burden of his song was&mdash;Prudence!
Prudence! Thomas, and you'll rise. His maxims rooted in my heart, and
as I grew&mdash;<i>they</i> grew; till I was reckoned, among our friends, a
steady, sober, solid, good young man; and all the neighbours call'd
me <i>the prudent Mr. Thomas</i>. And shall I now, at once, kick down the
character which I have raised so warily?&mdash;Part with her&mdash;sell her!&mdash;The
thought once struck me in our cabin, as she lay sleeping by me; but, in
her slumbers, she passed her arm around me, murmured a blessing on my
name, and broke my meditations.

SCENE II.

<p class="scene">
    <i>An Apartment in the House of <span class="sc">Sir Christopher Curry</span>.</i>
</p>
<p class="dir-c">
<i>Enter <span class="sc">Sir Christopher</span> and <span class="sc">Medium</span>.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Sir Chr.</i> I tell you, old Medium, you are all wrong. Plague on your
doubts! Inkle <i>shall</i> have my Narcissa. Poor fellow! I dare say he's
finely chagrined at this temporary parting&mdash;Eat up with the blue
devils, I warrant.
</p>
<p>
<i>Med.</i> Eat up by the black devils, I warrant; for I left him in hellish
hungry company.
</p>
<p>
<i>Sir Chr.</i> Pshaw! he'll arrive with the next vessel, depend
on't&mdash;besides, have not I had this in view ever since they were
children? I must and will have it so, I tell you. Is not it, as it
were, a marriage made above? They <i>shall</i> meet, I'm positive.
</p>
<p>
<i>Med.</i> Shall they? Then they must meet where the marriage was made; for
hang me, if I think it will ever happen below.
</p>
<p>
<i>Sir Chr.</i> Ha!&mdash;and if that is the case&mdash;hang me, if I think you'll
ever be at the celebration of it.
</p>
<p>
<i>Med.</i> Yet, let me tell you, Sir Christopher Curry, my character is as
unsullied as a sheet of white paper.
</p>
<p>
<i>Sir Chr.</i> Well said, old fool's-cap! and it's as mere a blank as a
sheet of white paper. You are honest,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page38" name="page38"></a>[38]</span>

                                      old Medium, by comparison, just
as a fellow sentenced to transportation is happier than his companion
condemned to the gallows&mdash;Very worthy, because you are no rogue; tender
hearted, because you never go to fires and executions; and an affectionate
father and husband, because you never pinch your children, or kick your
wife out of bed.
</p>
<p>
<i>Med.</i> And that, as the world goes, is more than every man can say for
himself. Yet, since you force me to speak my positive qualities&mdash;but,
no matter,&mdash;you remember me in London; didn't I, as member of the
Humane Society, bring a man out of the New River, who, it was
afterwards found, had done me an injury?
</p>
<p>
<i>Sir Chr.</i> And, dam'me, if I would not kick any man into the New River
that had done me an injury. There's the difference of our honesty.
Oons! if you want to be an honest fellow, act from the impulse of
nature. Why, you have no more gall than a pigeon.
</p>
<p>
<i>Med.</i> And you have as much gall as a turkey cock, and are as hot into
the bargain&mdash;You're always so hasty; among the hodge-podge of your
foibles, passion is always predominant.
</p>
<p>
<i>Sir Chr.</i> So much the better.&mdash;&mdash;Foibles, quotha? foibles are foils
that give additional lustre to the gems of virtue. You have not so many
foils as I, perhaps.
</p>
<p>
<i>Med.</i> And, what's more, I don't want 'em, Sir Christopher, I thank you.
</p>
<p>
<i>Sir Chr.</i> Very true; for the devil a gem have you to set off with 'em.
</p>
<p>
<i>Med.</i> Well, well; I never mention errors; that, I flatter myself, is
no disagreeable quality.&mdash;It don't become me to say you are hot.
</p>
<p>
<i>Sir Chr.</i> 'Sblood! but it does become you: it becomes every man,
especially an Englishman, to speak the dictates of his heart.

<p>

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<i>Sir Chr.</i> Pooh! pr'ythee! I tell you I pitied you from the bottom of
my heart.
</p>
<p>
<i>Camp.</i> Indeed! if, with your leave, I may still venture to mention
Miss Narcissa&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<i>Sir Chr.</i> An impatient, sensible young dog! like me to a hair! Set
your heart at rest, my boy. She's yours; yours before to-morrow morning.
</p>
<p>
<i>Camp.</i> Amazement! I can scarce believe my senses.
</p>
<p>
<i>Sir Chr.</i> Zounds! you ought to be out of your senses: but dispatch&mdash;make
short work of it, ever while you live, my boy. Here she is.

old gentleman.&mdash;But here&mdash;Take him, and make much of him&mdash;and, for fear
of further separations, you shall e'en be tacked together directly.
What say you, girl?
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<i>Nar.</i> I always obey my father's commands, with pleasure, sir.
</p>
<p>

have the carriage directly; drive down to the quay; trundle old Spintext
into church, and hey for matrimony!

<h3>
SCENE I.
</h3>
<p class="scene">
    <i>The Quay.</i>
</p>
<p class="dir-c">
<i>Enter <span class="sc">Patty</span>.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Patty.</i> Mercy on us! what a walk I have had of it! Well, matters go on
swimmingly at the Governor's&mdash;The old gentleman has ordered the carriage,
and the young couple will be whisked here, to church,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page44" name="page44"></a>[44]</span>

                                                      in a quarter of an
hour. My business is to prevent young sobersides, young Inkle, from
appearing, to interrupt the ceremony.&mdash;Ha! here's the Crown, where I
hear he is housed: So now to find Trudge, and trump up a story, in the
true style of a chambermaid. <span class="dir-i">[<i>Goes into the house.</i>]</span> <span class="dir-i">[<i><span class="sc">Patty</span>
within.</i>]</span> I tell you it don't signify, and I will come up. <span class="dir-i">[<i><span class="sc">Trudge</span>
within.</i>]</span> But it does signify, and you can't come up.
</p>

<p class="dir-c">
<i>Re-enter <span class="sc">Patty</span> with <span class="sc">Trudge</span>.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Patty.</i> You had better say at once, I shan't.
</p>
<p>
<i>Trudge.</i> Well then, you shan't.
</p>
<p>
<i>Patty.</i> Savage! Pretty behaviour you have picked up amongst the
Hottypots! Your London civility, like London itself, will soon be lost
in smoke, Mr. Trudge: and the politeness you have studied so long in
Threadneedle-street, blotted out by the blacks you have been living
with.
</p>
<p>
<i>Trudge.</i> No such thing; I practised my politeness all the while I was
in the woods. Our very lodging taught me good manners; for I could
never bring myself to go into it without bowing.
</p>
<p>
<i>Patty.</i> Don't tell me! A mighty civil reception you give a body,
truly, after a six weeks parting.
</p>
<p>
<i>Trudge.</i> Gad, you're right; I am a little out here, to be sure.
<span class="dir-i">[<i>Kisses her.</i>]</span> Well, how do you do?
</p>
<p>
<i>Patty.</i> Pshaw, fellow! I want none of your kisses.
</p>
<p>
<i>Trudge.</i> Oh! very well&mdash;I'll take it again. <span class="dir-i">[<i>Offers to kiss her.</i>]</span>
</p>
<p>
<i>Patty.</i> Be quiet. I want to see Mr. Inkle: I have a message to him
from Miss Narcissa. I shall get a sight of him, now, I believe.
</p>
<p>
<i>Trudge.</i> May be not. He's a little busy at present.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page45" name="page45"></a>[45]</span></p>

<p>
<i>Patty.</i> Busy&mdash;ha! Plodding! What he's at his multiplication table again?
</p>
<p>
<i>Trudge.</i> Very likely; so it would be a pity to interrupt him, you know.
</p>
<p>
<i>Patty.</i> Certainly; and the whole of my business was to prevent his
hurrying himself&mdash;Tell him, we shan't be ready to receive him, at the
Governor's, till to-morrow, d'ye hear?
</p>
<p>
<i>Trudge.</i> No?
</p>
<p>
<i>Patty.</i> No. Things are not prepared. The place isn't in order; and the
servants have not had proper notice of the arrival. Sir Christopher
intends Mr. Inkle, you know, for his son-in-law, and must receive him
in public form, (which can't be till to-morrow morning) for the honour
of his governorship: why the whole island will ring of it.
</p>
<p>
<i>Trudge.</i> The devil it will!
</p>
<p>
<i>Patty.</i> Yes; they've talked of nothing but my mistress's beauty and
fortune for these six weeks. Then he'll be introduced to the bride, you
know.
</p>
<p>
<i>Trudge.</i> O, my poor master!
</p>
<p>
<i>Patty.</i> Then a breakfast; then a procession; then&mdash;if nothing happens
to prevent it, he'll get into church, and be married in a crack.
</p>
<p>
<i>Trudge.</i> Then he'll get into a damn'd scrape, in a crack.
</p>
<p>
<i>Patty.</i> Hey-day! a scrape! How!
</p>
<p>
<i>Trudge.</i> Nothing, nothing&mdash;&mdash;It must out&mdash;&mdash;Patty!
</p>
<p>
<i>Patty.</i> Well!
</p>
<p>
<i>Trudge.</i> Can you keep a secret?
</p>
<p>
<i>Patty.</i> Try me.
</p>
<p>
<i>Trudge.</i> Then <span class="dir-i">[<i>Whispering.</i>]</span> My master keeps a girl.
</p>
<p>
<i>Patty.</i> Oh, monstrous! another woman?
</p>
<p>
<i>Trudge.</i> As sure as one and one make two.
</p>
<p>
<i>Patty.</i> <span class="dir-i">[<i>Aside.</i>]</span> Rare news for my mistress!&mdash;Why

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page46" name="page46"></a>[46]</span>

                                                     I can hardly believe
it: the grave, sly, steady, sober Mr. Inkle, do such a thing!
</p>
<p>
<i>Trudge.</i> Pooh! it's always your sly, sober fellows, that go the most
after the girls.
</p>
<p>
<i>Patty.</i> Well; I should sooner suspect <i>you</i>.
</p>
<p>
<i>Trudge.</i> Me? Oh Lord! he! he!&mdash;Do you think any smart, tight, little,
black-eyed wench, would be struck with my figure? <span class="dir-i">[<i>Conceitedly.</i>]</span>
</p>
<p>
<i>Patty.</i> Pshaw! never mind your figure. Tell me how it happened?
</p>
<p>
<i>Trudge.</i> You shall hear: when the ship left us ashore, my master
turned as pale as a sheet of paper. It isn't every body that's blest
with courage, Patty.
</p>
<p>
<i>Patty.</i> True.
</p>
<p>
<i>Trudge.</i> However, I bid him cheer up; told him, to stick to my elbow:
took the lead, and began our march.
</p>
<p>
<i>Patty.</i> Well?
</p>
<p>
<i>Trudge.</i> We hadn't gone far, when a damn'd one-eyed black boar, that
grinned like a devil, came down the hill in jog trot! My Master melted
as fast as a pot of pomatum!
</p>
<p>
<i>Patty.</i> Mercy on us!
</p>
<p>
<i>Trudge.</i> But what does I do, but whips out my desk knife, that I used
to cut the quills with at home; met the monster, and slit up his throat
like a pen&mdash;The boar bled like a pig.
</p>
<p>
<i>Patty.</i> Lord! Trudge, what a great traveller you are!
</p>
<p>
<i>Trudge.</i> Yes; I remember we fed on the flitch for a week.
</p>
<p>
<i>Patty.</i> Well, well; but the lady.
</p>
<p>
<i>Trudge.</i> The lady! Oh, true. By and by we came to a cave&mdash;a large
hollow room, under ground, like a warehouse in the Adelphi.&mdash;Well;
there we were half an hour, before I could get him to go in; there's no
accounting for fear, you know. At

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page47" name="page47"></a>[47]</span>

                                  last, in we went, to a place hung round
with skins, as it might be a furrier's shop, and there was a fine lady,
snoring on a bow and arrows.
</p>
<p>
<i>Patty.</i> What, all alone?
</p>
<p>
<i>Trudge.</i> Eh!&mdash;No&mdash;no.&mdash;Hum&mdash;She had a young lion, by way of a lap-dog.
</p>
<p>
<i>Patty.</i> Gemini; what did you do?
</p>
<p>
<i>Trudge.</i> Gave her a jog, and she opened her eyes&mdash;she struck my master
immediately.
</p>
<p>
<i>Patty.</i> Mercy on us! with what?
</p>
<p>
<i>Trudge.</i> With her beauty, you ninny, to be sure: and they soon brought
matters to bear. The wolves witnessed the contract&mdash;I gave her away&mdash;The
crows croaked amen; and we had board and lodging for nothing.
</p>
<p>
<i>Patty.</i> And this is she he has brought to Barbadoes?
</p>
<p>
<i>Trudge.</i> The same.
</p>
<p>
<i>Patty.</i> Well; and tell me, Trudge;&mdash;she's pretty, you say&mdash;Is she fair
or brown? or&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<i>Trudge.</i> Um! she's a good comely copper.
</p>
<p>
<i>Patty.</i> How! a tawny?
</p>
<p>
<i>Trudge.</i> Yes, quite dark; but very elegant; like a Wedgwood tea-pot.
</p>
<p>
<i>Patty.</i> Oh! the monster! the filthy fellow! Live with a black-a-moor!
</p>
<p>
<i>Trudge.</i> Why, there's no great harm in't, I hope?
</p>
<p>
<i>Patty.</i> Faugh! I wou'dn't let him kiss me for the world: he'd make my
face all smutty.
</p>
<p>
<i>Trudge.</i> Zounds! you are mighty nice all of a sudden; but I'd have you
to know, Madam Patty, that Black-a-moor ladies, as you call 'em, are
some of the very few whose complexions never rub off! 'Sbud, if they
did, Wows and I should have changed faces by this time&mdash;But mum; not a
word for your life.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page48" name="page48"></a>[48]</span></p>

<p>
<i>Patty.</i> Not I! except to the Governor and family. <span class="dir-i">[<i>Aside.</i>]</span> But I
must run&mdash;and, remember, Trudge, if your master has made a mistake
here, he has himself to thank for his pains.
</p>
<p class="dir-r">
[<i>Exit <span class="sc">Patty</span>.</i>
</p>

<p>
<i>Trudge.</i> Pshaw! these girls are so plaguy proud of their white and
red! but I won't be shamed out of Wows, that's flat.&mdash;
</p>

<p class="dir-c">
<i>Enter <span class="sc">Wowski</span>.</i>
</p>
<p>
Ah! Wows, I'm going to leave you.
</p>
<p>
<i>Wows.</i> For what you leave me?
</p>
<p>
<i>Trudge.</i> Master says I must.
</p>
<p>
<i>Wows.</i> Ah, but you say in your country, women know best; and I say you
not leave me.
</p>
<p>
<i>Trudge.</i> Master, to be sure, while we were in the forest, taught
Yarico to read, with his pencil and pocket-book. What then? Wows comes
on fine and fast in her lessons. A little awkward at first, to be
sure&mdash;Ha! ha!&mdash;She's so used to feed with her hands, that I can't get
her to eat her victuals, in a genteel, christian way, for the soul of
me; when she has stuck a morsel on her fork, she don't know how to
guide it, but pops up her knuckles to her mouth, and the meat goes up
to her ear. But, no matter&mdash;After all the fine, flashy London girls,
Wowski's the wench for my money.

SCENE II.
</h3>
<p class="scene">
    <i>A Room in the Crown.</i>
</p>
<p class="dir-c">
[<i>Enter <span class="sc">Inkle</span>.</i>]
</p>

<p>
<i>Inkle.</i> I know not what to think&mdash;I have given her distant hints of
parting; but still, so strong her confidence in my affection, she
prattles on without

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page50" name="page50"></a>[50]</span>

                     regarding me. Poor Yarico! I must not&mdash;cannot quit
her. When I would speak, her look, her mere simplicity disarms me; I dare
not wound such innocence. Simplicity is like a smiling babe, which, to
the ruffian that would murder it, stretching its little naked, helpless
arms, pleads, speechless, its own cause. And yet, Narcissa's family&mdash;
</p>

<p class="dir-c">
<i>Enter <span class="sc">Trudge</span>.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Trudge.</i> There he is; like a beau bespeaking a coat&mdash;doubting which
colour to choose&mdash;Sir&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<i>Inkle.</i> What now?
</p>
<p>
<i>Trudge.</i> Nothing unexpected, sir:&mdash;I hope you won't be angry; but I am
come to give you joy, sir!
</p>
<p>
<i>Inkle.</i> Joy!&mdash;&mdash;of what?
</p>
<p>
<i>Trudge.</i> A wife, sir! a white one.&mdash;I know it will vex you, but Miss
Narcissa means to make you happy, to-morrow morning.
</p>
<p>
<i>Inkle.</i> To-morrow!
</p>
<p>
<i>Trudge.</i> Yes, sir; and as I have been out of employ, in both my
capacities, lately, after I have dressed your hair, I may draw up the
marriage articles.
</p>
<p>
<i>Inkle.</i> Whence comes your intelligence, sir?
</p>
<p>
<i>Trudge.</i> Patty told me all that has passed in the Governor's family,
on the quay, sir. Women, you know, can never keep a secret. You'll be
introduced in form, with the whole island to witness it.
</p>
<p>
<i>Inkle.</i> So public, too!&mdash;&mdash;Unlucky!
</p>
<p>
<i>Trudge.</i> There will be nothing but rejoicings, in compliment to the
wedding, she tells me; all noise and uproar! Married people like it,
they say.
</p>
<p>
<i>Inkle.</i> Strange! that I should be so blind to my interest, as to be
the only person this distresses.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page51" name="page51"></a>[51]</span></p>

<p>
<i>Trudge.</i> They are talking of nothing else but the match, it seems.
</p>
<p>
<i>Inkle.</i> Confusion! How can I, in honour, retract?
</p>
<p>
<i>Trudge.</i> And the bride's merits&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<i>Inkle.</i> True!&mdash;A fund of merits!&mdash;I would not&mdash;but from necessity&mdash;a
case so nice as this&mdash;I&mdash;would not wish to retract.
</p>
<p>
<i>Trudge.</i> Then they call her so handsome.
</p>
<p>
<i>Inkle.</i> Very true! so handsome! the whole world would laugh at me;
they'd call it folly to retract.
</p>
<p>
<i>Trudge.</i> And then they say so much of her fortune.
</p>
<p>
<i>Inkle.</i> O death! it would be <i>madness</i> to retract. Surely, my
faculties have slept, and this long parting from my Narcissa has
blunted my sense of her accomplishments. 'Tis this alone makes me so
weak and wavering. I'll see her immediately. <span class="dir-i">[<i>Going.</i>]</span>
</p>
<p>
<i>Trudge.</i> Stay, stay, sir; I am desired to tell you, the Governor won't
open his gates to us till to-morrow morning.
</p>
<p>
<i>Inkle.</i> Well, be it so; it will give me time, at all events, to put my
affairs in train.
</p>
<p>
<i>Trudge.</i> Yes; it's a short respite before execution; and if your
honour was to go and comfort poor Madam Yarico&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<i>Inkle.</i> Damnation! Scoundrel, how dare you offer your advice?&mdash;I dread
to think of her!

laid awake, and fancied I saw you sleeping your last, with your head in

them safe in church, in the middle of the ceremony. I ought to have
given Narcissa away, they told me; but I capered about so much for joy,
that Old Spintext advised me to go and cool my heels on the quay, till

<i>Inkle.</i> Now for dispatch! Hark'ee, old gentleman! <span class="dir-i">[<i>To the Governor.</i>]</span>
</p>
<p>
<i>Sir Chr.</i> Well, young gentleman?
</p>
<p>
<i>Inkle.</i> If I mistake not, I know your business here.
</p>
<p>
<i>Sir Chr.</i> 'Egad, I believe half the island knows it, by this time.
</p>
<p>
<i>Inkle.</i> Then to the point&mdash;I have a female, whom I wish to part with.
</p>
<p>
<i>Sir Chr.</i> Very likely; it's a common case, now a-days, with many a man.
</p>
<p>
<i>Inkle.</i> If you could satisfy me you would use her mildly, and treat
her with more kindness than is usual&mdash;for I can tell you she's of no
common stamp&mdash;perhaps we might agree.
</p>
<p>
<i>Sir Chr.</i> Oho! a slave! Faith, now I think on't, my daughter may want
an attendant or two extraordinary; and as you say she's a delicate
girl, above the common run, and none of your thick-lipped, flat-nosed,
squabby, dumpling dowdies, I don't much care if&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<i>Inkle.</i> And for her treatment&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<i>Sir Chr.</i> Look ye, young man; I love to be plain: I shall treat her
a good deal better than you would, I fancy; for though I witness this
custom every day, I can't help thinking the only excuse for buying our
fellow creatures, is to rescue them from the hands of those who are
unfeeling enough to bring them to market.
</p>
<p>
<i>Inkle.</i> Fair words, old gentleman; an Englishman won't put up an affront.
</p>
<p>
<i>Sir Chr.</i> An Englishman! more shame for you!

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page56" name="page56"></a>[56]</span>

                                              Let Englishmen blush at
such practices. Men, who so fully feel the blessings of liberty, are
doubly cruel in depriving the helpless of their freedom.
</p>
<p>
<i>Inkle.</i> Let me assure you, sir, it is not my occupation; but for a
private reason&mdash;an instant pressing necessity&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<i>Sir Chr.</i> Well, well, I have a pressing necessity too; I can't stand
to talk now; I expect company here presently; but if you'll ask for me
to-morrow, at the Castle&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<i>Inkle.</i> The Castle!
</p>
<p>
<i>Sir Chr.</i> Aye, sir, the Castle; the Governor's Castle; known all over
Barbadoes.
</p>
<p>
<i>Inkle.</i> 'Sdeath this man must be on the Governor's establishment:
his steward, perhaps, and sent after me, while Sir Christopher is
impatiently waiting for me. I've gone too far; my secret may be
known&mdash;As 'tis, I'll win this fellow to my interest. <span class="dir-i">[<i>To him.</i>]</span>&mdash;One
word more, sir: my business must be done immediately; and as you seem
acquainted at the Castle, if you should see me there&mdash;and there I mean
to sleep to-night&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<i>Sir Chr.</i> The devil you do!
</p>
<p>
<i>Inkle.</i> Your finger on your lips; and never breathe a syllable of this
transaction.
</p>
<p>
<i>Sir Chr.</i> No! Why not?
</p>
<p>
<i>Inkle.</i> Because, for reasons, which, perhaps, you'll know to-morrow, I
might be injured with the Governor, whose most particular friend I am.
</p>
<p>
<i>Sir Chr.</i> So! here's a particular friend of mine, coming to sleep
at my house, that I never saw in my life. I'll sound this fellow.
<span class="dir-i">[<i>Aside.</i>]</span> I fancy, young gentleman, as you are such a bosom friend of
the Governor's, you can hardly do any thing to alter your situation
with him?

doubtless, know his character?
</p>
<p>
<i>Sir Chr.</i> Oh, as well as I do my own. But let's understand one
another. You may trust me, now you've gone so far. You are acquainted
with his character, no doubt, to a hair?
</p>
<p>
<i>Inkle.</i> I am&mdash;I see we shall understand each other. You know him too,
I see, as well as I.&mdash;A very touchy, testy, hot old fellow.
</p>
<p>
<i>Sir Chr.</i> Here's a scoundrel! I hot and touchy! Zounds! I can hardly
contain my passion!&mdash;But I won't discover myself. I'll see the bottom
of this&mdash;&mdash;<span class="dir-i">[<i>To him.</i>]</span> Well now, as we seem to have come to a tolerable
explanation&mdash;let's proceed to business&mdash;Bring me the woman.
</p>
<p>
<i>Inkle.</i> No; there you must excuse me. I rather would avoid seeing her
more; and wish it to be settled without my seeming interference. My
presence might distress her&mdash;You conceive me?
</p>
<p>
<i>Sir Chr.</i> Zounds! what an unfeeling rascal!&mdash;The poor girl's in love
with him, I suppose. No, no, fair and open. My dealing is with you and
you only: I see her now, or I declare off.

None of your princes, there, will come to take me from you. And should

                                                  boy&mdash;the jolly boy,
piping hot from church, with my daughter.
</p>

<p class="dir-c">
<i>Enter <span class="sc">Campley</span>, <span class="sc">Narcissa</span>, and <span class="sc">Patty</span>.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Med.</i> Campley!
</p>
<p>
<i>Sir Chr.</i> Who? Campley?&mdash;It's no such thing.
</p>
<p>
<i>Camp.</i> That's my name, indeed, Sir Christopher.
</p>
<p>
<i>Sir Chr.</i> The devil it is! And how came you, sir, to impose upon me,
and assume the name of Inkle? A name which every man of honesty ought
to be ashamed of.
</p>
<p>
<i>Camp.</i> I never did, sir.&mdash;Since I sailed from England with your
daughter, my affection has daily increased: and when I came to explain
myself to you, by a number of concurring circumstances, which I am now
partly acquainted with, you mistook me for that gentleman. Yet had I
even then been aware of your mistake, I must confess, the regard for my
own happiness would have tempted me to let you remain undeceived.
</p>
<p>
<i>Sir Chr.</i> And did you, Narcissa, join in&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<i>Nar.</i> How could I, my dear sir, disobey you?
</p>
<p>
<i>Patty.</i> Lord your honour, what young lady could refuse a captain?
</p>
<p>
<i>Camp.</i> I am a soldier, Sir Christopher. Love and war is the soldier's
motto; though my income is trifling to your <i>intended</i> son-in-law's,
still the chance of war has enabled me to support the object of my love
above indigence. Her fortune, Sir Christopher, I do not consider myself
by any means entitled to.
</p>
<p>
<i>Sir Chr.</i> 'Sblood! but you must though. Give me your hand, my young
Mars, and bless you both together!&mdash;Thank you, thank you for cheating
an old fellow into giving his daughter to a lad of spirit, when he was
going to throw her away upon one, in

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page64" name="page64"></a>[64]</span>

                                     whose breast the mean passion of
avarice smothers the smallest spark of affection or humanity.
</p>
<p>
<i>Nar.</i> I have this moment heard a story of a transaction in the forest,
which I own would have rendered compliance with your former commands
very disagreeable.
</p>
<p>
<i>Patty.</i> Yes, sir, I told my mistress he had brought over a Hottypot
gentlewoman.
</p>
<p>
<i>Sir Chr.</i> Yes, but he would have left her for you; <span class="dir-i">[<i>To Narcissa.</i>]</span>
and you for his interest; and sold you, perhaps, as he has this poor
girl to me, as a requital for preserving his life.
</p>
<p>
<i>Nar.</i> How!
</p>

<p class="dir-c">
<i>Enter <span class="sc">Trudge</span> and <span class="sc">Wowski</span>.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Trudge.</i> Come along, Wows! take a long last leave of your poor mistress:
throw your pretty, ebony arms about her neck.
</p>
<p>
<i>Wows.</i> No, no;&mdash;she not go; you not leave poor Wowski. <span class="dir-i">[<i>Throwing her
arms about <span class="sc">Yarico</span>.</i>]</span>
</p>
<p>
<i>Sir Chr.</i> Poor girl! A companion, I take it!
</p>
<p>
<i>Trudge.</i> A thing of my own, sir. I cou'dn't help following my master's
example in the woods&mdash;&mdash;<i>Like master, like man</i>, sir.
</p>
<p>
<i>Sir Chr.</i> But you would not sell her, and be hang'd to you, you dog,
would you?
</p>
<p>
<i>Trudge.</i> Hang me, like a dog, if I would, sir.
</p>
<p>
<i>Sir Chr.</i> So say I to every fellow that breaks an obligation due to
the feelings of a man. But, old Medium, what have you to say for your
hopeful nephew?
</p>
<p>
<i>Med.</i> I never speak ill of my friends, Sir Christopher.
</p>
<p>
<i>Sir Chr.</i> Pshaw!
</p>
<p>
<i>Inkle.</i> Then let me speak: hear me defend a conduct&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<i>Sir Chr.</i> Defend! Zounds! plead guilty at once&mdash;it's the only hope
left of obtaining mercy.
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page65" name="page65"></a>[65]</span></p>

<p>
<i>Inkle.</i> Suppose, old gentleman, you had a son?
</p>
<p>
<i>Sir Chr.</i> 'Sblood! then I'd make him an honest fellow; and teach him,
that the feeling heart never knows greater pride than when it's employed
in giving succour to the unfortunate. I'd teach him to be his father's
own son to a hair.
</p>
<p>
<i>Inkle.</i> Even so my father tutored me: from my infancy, bending my
tender mind, like a young sapling, to his will&mdash;Interest was the grand
prop round which he twined my pliant green affections: taught me in
childhood to repeat old sayings&mdash;all tending to his own fixed principles,
and the first sentence that I ever lisped, was&mdash;<i>Charity begins at home.</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>Sir Chr.</i> I shall never like a proverb again, as long as I live.
</p>
<p>
<i>Inkle.</i> As I grew up, he'd prove&mdash;and by example&mdash;were I in want, I
might e'en starve, for what the world cared for their neighbours; why
then should I care for the world? Men now lived for themselves. These
were his doctrines: then, sir, what would you say, should I, in spite
of habit, precept, education, fly in my father's face, and spurn his
councils?
</p>
<p>
<i>Sir Chr.</i> Say! why, that you were a damn'd honest, undutiful fellow. O
curse such principles! Principles, which destroy all confidence between
man and man&mdash;Principles which none but a rogue could instil, and none
but a rogue could imbibe.&mdash;Principles&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<i>Inkle.</i> Which I renounce.
</p>
<p>
<i>Sir Chr.</i> Eh!
</p>
<p>
<i>Inkle.</i> Renounce entirely. Ill-founded precept too long has steeled
my breast&mdash;but still 'tis vulnerable&mdash;this trial was too much&mdash;Nature,
'gainst habit combating within me, has penetrated to my heart; a heart,
I own, long callous to the feelings of sensibility; but now it bleeds&mdash;and
bleeds for my poor Yarico. Oh, let me clasp her to it, while 'tis glowing,
and

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page66" name="page66"></a>[66]</span>

    mingle tears of love and penitence. <span class="dir-i">[<i>Embracing her.</i>]</span>
</p>
<p>
<i>Trudge.</i> <span class="dir-i">[<i>Capering about.</i>]</span> Wows, give me a kiss! <span class="dir-i">[<i><span class="sc">Wowski</span> goes to
<span class="sc">Trudge</span>.</i>]</span>
</p>
<p>
<i>Yar.</i> And shall we&mdash;shall we be happy?
</p>
<p>
<i>Inkle.</i> Aye; ever, ever, Yarico.
</p>
<p>
<i>Yar.</i> I knew we should&mdash;and yet I feared&mdash;but shall I still watch over
you? Oh! love, you surely gave your Yarico such pain, only to make her
feel this happiness the greater.
</p>
<p>
<i>Wows.</i> <span class="dir-i">[<i>Going to <span class="sc">Yarico</span>.</i>]</span> Oh Wowski so happy!&mdash;and yet I
think I not glad neither.
</p>
<p>
<i>Trudge.</i> Eh, Wows! How!&mdash;why not!
</p>
<p>
<i>Wows.</i> 'Cause I can't help cry&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<i>Sir Chr.</i> Then, if that's the case&mdash;curse me, if I think I'm very glad
either. What the plague's the matter with my eyes?&mdash;Young man, your
hand&mdash;I am now proud and happy to shake it.
</p>
<p>
<i>Med.</i> Well, Sir Christopher, what do you say to my hopeful nephew now?
</p>
<p>
<i>Sir Chr.</i> Say! Why, confound the fellow, I say, that is ungenerous
enough to remember the bad action of a man who has virtue left in his
heart to repent it&mdash;As for you, my good fellow, <span class="dir-i">[<i>To <span class="sc">Trudge</span>.</i>]</span>
I must, with your master's permission, employ you myself.
</p>
<p>
<i>Trudge.</i> O rare!&mdash;Bless your honour!&mdash;Wows! you'll be lady, you jade,
to a governor's factotum.
</p>
<p>
<i>Wows.</i> Iss&mdash;I Lady Jactotum.
</p>
<p>
<i>Sir Chr.</i> And now, my young folks, we'll drive home, and celebrate the
wedding. Od's my life! I long to be shaking a foot at the fiddles, and
I shall dance ten times the lighter, for reforming an Inkle, while I
have it in my power to reward the innocence of a Yarico.

Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
